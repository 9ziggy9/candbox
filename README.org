* Notes on Low-Level Programming for High-Level Engineers
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The following is a set of notes on low-level system
programming targetting programmers more accustomed
to the higher-level world of interpreted languages.\\

I am *NOT* an expert in C programming and I can barely
follow any assembler language that is not nasm. This
document may contain many incorrect statements but I
bet you that your GPT4 won't say "mother fucker" in an
introduction, mother fucker.\\

Each day we've worked on this repo will be separated into
branches, if you want to follow sequentially as this repo
has evolved, select the branch by day (day-one) being the
branch corresponding to the state of the repo at the time
of writing this message.\\

Have fun and please feel free to absolutely roast me for
any and all statements.\\
